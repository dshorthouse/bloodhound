  Specimens included in this project were collected 1970-2018 and have content in their 
  %a{href: "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#recordedBy"} recordedBy 
  (collector) and 
  %a{href: "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#identifiedBy"} identifiedBy 
  Darwin Core fields. Collector and determiner names were pre-parsed and cleaned using the 
  %a{href: "https://rubygems.org/gems/namae" } Namae gem 
  among other custom regular expressions. They were also partially reconciled by pruning 
  %a{href: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)"} weighted graphs 
  of surnames whose edges were marked with a similarity score. The scoring algorithm favoured instances of co-collector names (i.e. people often collect with the same group of friends), overlap in overall collection and determination date ranges, and taxon similarity (i.e. people often collect taxa within the same taxonomic Families) in an effort to help infer that different names represent the same person. For example, 
  %em John Bain
  is likely the same person as 
  %em John F. Bain 
  because instances of both names were associated with people with the surnames Poole, Kerr, or Turner, their collection dates and determination dates overlapped, and both collected or identified grasses.

  If you declared alternate names in your ORCID account (e.g. a maiden name), these are also used to search for specimen records, which are then presented to you in greatest to least likely collected or identified by you.

%h3 Background

%p
  Despite the world-wide importance of natural history collections, most are at risk because they are critically underfunded or undervalued. A significant contributing factor for this apparent neglect is the lack of a professional reward system; one that articulates and quantifies the breadth and depth of activities and expertise required to collect and identify specimens, maintain them, digitize their labels, mobilize the data, and enhance these data as errors and omissions are identified by stakeholders. If people throughout the full value-chain in natural history collections received professional credit for their efforts, ideally recognized by their administrators and funding bodies, they would prioritize traditionally unrewarded tasks and could convincingly self-advocate. Proper methods of attribution at both the individual and institutional level are essential. This proof-of-concept targets the acts of collecting and identifying specimens - arguably the most important parts of this progression.

%p
  As a direct consequence of a reward system, the wider biodiversity community would finally benefit from a rapid way to obtain accurate answers to questions such as, 
  %em "Who is an expert collector or determiner of taxon X?"
  , or 
  %em "Who is an expert collector or determiner of taxon X in a particular region of the world)?"
  , or indeed 
  %em "Who has collected at a particular place in the world and as a consequence, ought to be familiar with local collecting regulations and how to apply for permits?" 
  without having to resort to mining the taxonomic literature. Use-cases like these and others are met in surprising ways if we had a mechanism to unequivocally stitch people and their identities to legacy specimen data. This "Bloodhound" proof-of-concept is a first step to do just that.

%p
  The 
  %a{href: "https://www.gbif.org"} Global Biodiversity Information Facility 
  (GBIF) itself has prioritized a focus on people. The very first planned item in their 
  %a{href: "https://www.gbif.org/document/83029/gbif-implementation-plan-2017-2021-and-annual-work-programme-2017" }Implementation Plan for 2017-2021 
  and Annual Work Programme states, "1.a.i: Develop mechanisms to support and reflect the skills, expertise and experience of individual and organizational contributions to the GBIF network, including revision of identity management system and integration of ORCID identifiers". They have explicitly recognized that 
  %a{href: "https://www.orcid.org"} ORCID 
  is the organization that is best positioned to capture and resolve the identity of people in academia and professional settings. However, a bottleneck that prevents the full execution of GBIF's plan is a legacy of seemingly intractable, text-based content shared from natural history museums that ambiguously record people or organizations implicated in specimen data, none of which include pre-determined links to ORCID identifiers. Typical content shared under the Darwin Core terms 
  %a{href: "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#recordedBy"} recordedBy 
  (collector) and 
  %a{href: "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#identifidBy"} identifiedBy 
  (determiners) is unstructured and highly variable. They may include ordered or unorderd people names, suffer from insensitivity to cultural preferences, express the full or abbreviated names of organizations, or indeed include combinations of people and organization names. What may emerge from this proof-of-concept is a library of code and techniques to help our community reconcile people names. These work best in a large aggregation of data. We've become reasonably adept at doing this for scientific names, now we need to do it for people - our most important resource.
